    Acolyte (PHB pg. 127)
You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods.
You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine.
You are not necessarily a cleric; performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight & Religion

Charlatan (PHB pg. 128)
You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with
a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seem s to be in short supply when you’re around.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception & Sleight of Hand

Entertainer/Gladiator (PHB pg. 130)
You thrive in front of an audience. You know how to entrance them, entertain them, and even inspire them. Your poetics can stir the hearts of those who hear
you, awakening grief or joy, laughter or anger. Your music raises their spirits or captures their sorrow. Your dance steps captivate, your humor cuts to the
quick. Whatever techniques you use, your art is your life.

---

Folk Hero (PHB pg. 131)
You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more. Already the people of your home village regard you as their champion, and your
destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere. You previously pursued a simple profession among the
peasantry but something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things.
Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling & Survival

Guild Artisan (PHB pg. 132)
You are a member of an artisan’s guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile
world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the
sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight & Persuasion

Hermit (PHB pg. 134)
You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone—for a formative part of your life. In your time apart from the
clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, and perhaps some of the answers you were looking for. What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed
to allow you to end your solitude?
Skill Proficiencies: Medicine & Religion

---

Noble/Knight (PHB pg. 135)
You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar
with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could
be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
Skill Proficiencies: History & Persuasion

Outlander (PHB pg. 136)
You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. You’ve witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived
weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. The
wilds are in your blood, whether you were a nomad, an explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics & Survival

Sage (PHB pg. 137)
You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the greatest experts on the subjects that interest
you. Your efforts have made you a master in your fields of study.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana & History

---

Sailor/Pirate (PHB pg. 139)
You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the
bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new. What were your duties on
board—boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position?
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics & Perception

Solider (PHB pg. 140)
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques,
including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local
militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics & Intimidation

Urchin (PHB pg. 141)
You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal
from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate.
You’ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
