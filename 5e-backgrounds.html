                        You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods.
                        You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred
                        rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine.
                        You are not necessarily a cleric; performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling
                        divine power.

                            their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions
                            you can read them like they were children's books.
                            It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
                            Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common
                            sense seems to be in short supply when you're around.
