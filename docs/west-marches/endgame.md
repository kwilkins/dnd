Endgame
======

Alright gang, we've had 61+ sessions of the West Marches; there's been a few multiparters, but as far as the official records are concerned we've had 61. I'm honestly shocked at how long we've been doing this and am amazed with how much mileage we've gotten at the same time. I love running this game and I love playing with all of you! When I started this I thought it would be crazy if we could play 100 sessions, and that is apparently going to become a reality. I've settled on two main decisions for the lands surrounding Padfoot's Landing and wanted to share them outside of game so we can all get the most out of the rest of this game together.

  1) I'm hoping to end this run somewhere around session 100. That doesn't mean 100 will be the last one. That doesn't mean if you played in session 97 you won't be able to play in the final adventure. I'm hoping to have everyone, that is interested, play a handful of sessions before some kind of big climactic/resolution scenario. I want to involve everyone in a meaningful way, so if you want in I will try everything in my power to make it happen.
  2) I'm hoping to start moving and shaking the world with some of the various factions starting with session 75, there are 13 more sessions before that. The level cap in the West Marches was always intended to be 10, not that anyone was expected to get there...I just want to give you each some time to play/level characters and investigate any leads you'd like to have for the end game!

The endgame *will* be full of danger but still inline with how I've been running the game so far. While the West Marches was always intended to be more on the dangerous/deadly side of combat, I hope I've shown I haven't just been playing to kill/screw over your characters whenever I can. Honestly, everyone has played exceptionally well to get out of their own dicey situations, and that makes me happy to see! 

Lastly, I want to stress the amount of play, world building, and fun we've all had is absolutely not just from me and my notes. You each have poured so much into this world and helped shape it. It would ***NOT*** be anywhere near what it is without all of you. So from the bottom of my d&d heart, thank you!

And if you're hungry for some more shared world d&d action, don't worry there's something cooking in a large underground cavern complex for you all to explore...
