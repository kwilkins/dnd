# D&D Rules Stuffs

## What is this?
This is a reference document detailing house rules, expanded options, and how I approach different aspects of games that I run. The goal being that the content in here should make the game more compelling, more rewarding, but most of all more fun! If anything in here is found to be hindering one of these goals it will be addressed or changed as needed. And if you have an idea or found a resource that you think would be awesome to add, talk to me about it! This is an evolving document and feedback is always welcome.
