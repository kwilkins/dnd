# D&D Rules Stuffs

## What is this?
This is a reference document detailing house rules, expanded options, and how I approach different aspects of games that I run. The goal being that the content in here should make the game more compelling, more rewarding, but most of all more fun! If anything in here is found to be hindering one of these goals it will be addressed or changed as needed. And if you have an idea or found a resource that you think would be awesome to add, talk to me about it! This is an evolving document and feedback is always welcome.

## Interpreting Rules
There are all kinds of different ways of following rules, here are some general ideas behind a few different interpretations.

* RAW – Rules as Written
    * What the text says as written literally. This is generally where we start when considering any sort of ruling.
* RAI – Rules as Intended
    * This approach is what the designer meant when the rule was created. Sometimes the words written don’t successfully communicate the original intent, or there was an oversight in the original text. The meaning behind these rules usually get clarified or fixed in a later publishing.
* RAF – Rules as Fun
    * Sometimes we depart from what is written or what was intended, because D&D is primarily meant to be **fun**. Ignoring the fact that the spell *animal friendship* isn't supposed to work on monstrosities, the owlbear rolling a natural 1 for his save against the spell allows it to become charmed by Wrenn. This creates an incredibly fun scene and one of the most memorable moments for the campaign.

All this is to say that there will be times when we follow the rules as written, there will be times when we follow the rules as intended, and there will be times when we purposely ignore rules to have a good time.

## Fifth Edition

Everybody has their own opinion on the many different editions and variants of Dungeons and Dragons. My first introduction to D&D was watching the original Rollplay series, a campaign run using a modified version of second edition D&D, so it’s fair to say I have fond memories of old school role playing game elements – death always being a possibility, semi permanent effects, meaningful consequences, and the game rules feeling grounded. In some ways, Fifth Edition (5e) can be seen as a departure from that style of play – some abilities break any sense of realism, many spells require addendums for special cases, and simply resting for a bit can heal wounds from swords or spells. 5e sacrifices many of these old core designs to make the game more easily digestible for its players, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For this part of the game’s design, Wizards of the Coast spectacularly succeeded and has given D&D a resurgence of popularity in the last few years.

That said, even the lead designer behind 5e wishes they had done some things differently – like removing the bonus action. Another great thing about 5e is that it was also written with the idea in mind for variant rules and system modifications, which is great because the mechanics are easy to change when something doesn’t quite work like I’d like. So, in these two areas I really enjoy 5e as a system because it easily allows a group of players to play the game the way they want.
