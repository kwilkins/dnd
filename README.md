## /docs
kwilkins D&D homebrew rules, documentation, etc.
You can find the compiled documents at https://kwilkinsdnd.readthedocs.io.

## /kwilkins-mkdocs-theme
A custom mkdocs theme based on the default one.
I changed toc.html to display the page's header contents based off of a configurable depth level.
