## What is Unearthed Arcana?
> You can think of the material presented in this series as similar to the first wave of the fifth edition playtest. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. They are highly volatile and might be unstable; if you use them, be ready to rule on any issues that come up. They’re written in pencil, not ink.  
The material presented in Unearthed Arcana will range from mechanics that we expect one day to publish in a supplement to house rules from our home campaigns that we want to share, from core system options such as mass combat to setting-specific material such as the Eberron update included in this article. Once it’s out there, you can expect us to check in with you to see how it’s working out and what we can do to improve it.

## How to Judge New Content?
Roughly speaking I find myself judging what to allow in my games, unearthed arcana or otherwise, on a few criteria

  1. Does it steal the spotlight or outclass mechanics from existing content?
      * If unbalanced material is a better choice over an existing one 90% of the time, the existing class/spell/feat becomes obsolete.
      * Does this new Ranger subclass make it a better fighter than the Fighter?
  2. What parts of the game is it strengthening?
      * Does this material expand parts of the game that need more content? I'm usually more interested in adding things that are new or missing from the game than adding something that is similar-but-slightly-different.
      * Do we need a list of 10 additional kinds of weapons each with their own minute differences?
  3. Can we already do this?
      * Sometimes rule extensions or clarification do help and enhance the game. But if the game already easily allows for this mechanic to work without adding something new why should we?
      * Are specific rules for breaking down doors depending on their make, who built it, and how old it is needed if we can just set a DC against an Athletics check?
  4. Is it fun?
      * If it isn't fun to play in the game, then what's even the point?
      * A really complex trap with 5 different ways to interact with it might be perfectly balanced and interesting, but this could slow the game down and the players start getting bored.

## My Impressions on Unearthed Arcana
This isn't a complete list of all released UA content, usually if the content looks interesting or promising I'll dive into it more and assess it's use in my games.

  * #### Xanathar's Guide to Everything
  * #### Elf Subraces
  * #### Fiendish Options
  * #### Eladrin and Gith Races
  * #### Greyhawk Initiative System
  * #### Revised Class Options
  * #### Revised Subclasses
  * #### Feats for Races
  * #### Feats for Skills
    I’m not allowing any of these. Some are interesting enough, but others are really stretching the realm of the skill, or are too powerful agency wise.  My problem is that if I only allowed the ones I liked, I would be allowing feat expertise in some skills and not others.  I’ll be sticking with the idea that your skills are more tied to your race/class/background.
