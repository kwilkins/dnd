## What is Unearthed Arcana?
> You can think of the material presented in this series as similar to the first wave of the fifth edition playtest. These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. They are highly volatile and might be unstable; if you use them, be ready to rule on any issues that come up. They’re written in pencil, not ink.  
The material presented in Unearthed Arcana will range from mechanics that we expect one day to publish in a supplement to house rules from our home campaigns that we want to share, from core system options such as mass combat to setting-specific material such as the Eberron update included in this article. Once it’s out there, you can expect us to check in with you to see how it’s working out and what we can do to improve it.

## How to Judge New Content?
Roughly speaking I find myself judging what to allow in my games, unearthed arcana or otherwise, on a few criteria

  1. Does it steal the spotlight or outclass mechanics from existing content?
      * If unbalanced material is a better choice over an existing one 90% of the time, the existing class/spell/feat becomes obsolete.
      * Does this new Ranger subclass make it a better fighter than the Fighter?
  2. What parts of the game is it strengthening?
      * Does this material expand parts of the game that need more content? I'm usually more interested in adding things that are new or missing from the game than adding something that is similar-but-slightly-different.
      * Do we need a list of 10 additional kinds of weapons each with their own minute differences?
  3. Can we already do this?
      * Sometimes rule extensions or clarification do help and enhance the game. But if the game already easily allows for this mechanic to work without adding something new why should we?
      * Are specific rules for breaking down doors depending on their make, who built it, and how old it is needed if we can just set a DC against an Athletics check?
  4. Is it fun?
      * If it isn't fun to play in the game, then what's even the point?
      * A really complex trap with 5 different ways to interact with it might be perfectly balanced and interesting, but this could slow the game down and the players start getting bored.

## My Impressions on Unearthed Arcana
This isn't a complete list of all released UA content, usually if the content looks interesting or promising I'll dive into it more and assess it's use in my games.

  * #### Xanathar's Guide to Everything
  * #### Elf Subraces
  * #### Fiendish Options
  * #### Eladrin and Gith Races
  * #### Greyhawk Initiative System
  * #### Revised Class Options
  * #### Revised Subclasses
  * #### [Feats for Races](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/RJSJC2017_04UASkillFeats_24v10.pdf)
    I also like the idea of race having more impact later after character creation. Short of having level locked racial features, racial feats are a great way to accomplish this. Each of these racial feats take an aspect of that particular race and extend it, enhancing that character's abilities. Most of these are pretty great and are a worthy choice from the regular feat choices.
    
    Now that, that Xanathar's has been released, most of these feats have been introduced officially(with a few changes here and there). But there were some I really liked that didn't make the cut, so I'm including those.
    I’m allowing a selection of these feats to further aid racial impact in the game.
  * #### [Feats for Skills](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UA-SkillFeats.pdf)
    I like the idea of feats being able to give your character a skill proficiency that you are interested in, or weren't able to secure when initial character creation. The idea that your skills being tied to your race, class, or background feels good to me, but as my character grows there are skills that make sense for them to invest time and effort in learning or becoming proficient. And feats seem like a great way to allow that to happen since it would mean a decision between the other feat options. But, there already *is* the skilled feat, which lets you get three skill or tool proficiences.
    
    So, the I like the idea behind this. As a first draft I think these "Skills as Feats" are interesting enough and have potential but ultimately isn't executed well enough. Some I find really well done, some I think are pretty lame, but some are really stretching the realm of the skill. I don't like the idea of only allowing the ones I think are good enough because I would be allowing paths into some skills and not others. So in the spirit of being fair to every skill, I won't be introducing these in my games. I also don't like how they can grant expertise for a given skill. For me expertise is a special characteristic of the Bard or Rogue class, and I like keeping it locked there.

    This is one of my *favorite* pieces of UA! Not for the content(I like that too), but the write up we get on feat design and for each feat given(good or bad) is wonderful! I think the "good" feats are great additions to the game; diverse beyond just weapons, mechanically interesting, and seem fun.
