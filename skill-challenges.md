How to run the party escaping from a dangerous collapsing dungeon

## What is a Skill Challenge?
Skill challenges were a really cool feature introduced with D&D 4e allowing for a streamlined mechanic to play out complex situations more easily. However, they were also really badly explained and were given bad offical DCs(they eventually got them right two errata later). Gaining favor with the Queen over dinner, a chase across city rooftops, or attempting to disrupt a summoning ritual are all things that can easily happen in a game of D&D, but rarely can you resolve these things with a single character's skill check or straight forward grid combat. 

## Successes and Failures
The skill challenge involves the entire party making relevant skill checks to each contribute towards the overall goal. Each skill check results in a success or fail. The goal is to reach a certain number of successes(depending on the difficulty) before reaching three failures.

In order to attempt a check for the challenge, you must:
* be proficient in that skill
* not have used that skill for this challenge already

Different types of skills will each have their own DC for a success. Gaining favor with the local Queen might be *easy* through flattering her with persuasion but *hard* trying to bully her with intimidation. No matter what skill is being attempted, narrate or explain to the group how your character is using this skill to help in the challenege. Being clever in how you use a particular skill might give you a bonus!

Basic DC Table from DMG(p. 238)
| Task | DC |
|:-----|:--:|
| Very Easy | 5 |
| Easy | 10 |
| Moderate | 15 |
| Hard | 20 |
| Very Hard | 25 |
| Nearly Impossible | 30 |

## Consequences
Passing or failing the challenge comes with consequences. The party captures the assassin during the rooftop chase or she gets away. The outcome doesn't have to be binary either, the amount of failures achieved might make the next combat encounter more difficult.

Sometimes there are extra consequences for failing a skill check. Trying to escape from a collapsing dungeon and failing your investigation check to find a shortcut might open your character up for a piece of debri falling on your head.

## Starting a Skill Challenge
When a skill challenge begins, I will announced that we are starting a skill challenge, the consequences of passing or failing, and how many successes are needed to pass. I will also share a few examples of skills and how they could be used, but those aren't your only skill options. If you would like to use a different skill, describe how you could use it to help, I will decide if you can or not.
